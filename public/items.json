Painters, graphic artists, sculptors and architects, united for less traditional art and more freedom of expression. Klimt ranged between eroticism, landscapes and portraits, around 1814 he was criticized  for decorating the Great Hall of the University of Vienna with three audacious paintings. The three pieces were destroied when Schloss Immendorf was burned in May 1945."
